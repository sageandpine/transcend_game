# transcend_game
A text based game that follows a soul as it escapes from life and death.

Currently working on getting game to function as OOP style game with multiple Classes, import functions and keeping a record of where the player is and has been using a tally system that will trigger responses based on how player is doing.

Goal is to consolodate and simplify after things work.

Basic Idea:
A text based game that follows a soul as it escapes from life and death.
Goals:
1 Loop---To escape (L)ife you must pick up objects that represent attachment to the physical world, but help you progress. 3 levels like this but to finish (L)ife, you must empty the contents of your inventory into a wishing well.....Your consciosness dissolves and returns to the opening scene.
2 Loop----To escape (D)eath you must traverse the spirit/dream world and discover and pick up things that help you progress. More ethereal items that represent spiritual lessons....perhaps you encounter a man asking for food and you giv ehim bread. in turn you get humility as a glowing crystal.
3 levels like this but to finish (D)eath, you must have a full inventory and step into the wishing well.....Your conciousness dissolves and returns you to the opening scene.

Final Loop----You only return to the opening scene if you have not yet completed the unfinished loop. Once you have completed both (L)ife and (D)eath, your spirit re-solves into the eternal everything oneness of universal consciousness.......and then you return to the opening scene to begin again.

There are two paths to complete before you 
Opening scene:
Waking in a bedroom. Alarm is going off. You can either 
A). stay awake and make some coffee or 
B.) hit snooze and go back to sleep
